My name is **Allen David Hernandez**. A graduate of the University of Texas at Dallas. I am a first-generation Mexican-American who aims to be a full-stack developer. The reason why I have chosen to study for years in the field of computer science and join professional organizations, and hackathons is quite simple.  

For me, it is a way to learn and grow. I am a very curious person and I love to learn about coding. The ability to create a program that can make an impact whether is for me, my friends and family, or for the public. I can create or help contribute to the creation of such a project. Just knowing how to create and more importantly knowing how to learn the skills to create better programs than the previous ones. That never-ending cycle makes the profession of being a software developer is the reason why I am here.
