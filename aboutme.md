My name is *Allen David Hernandez*. A graduate from the University of Texas at Dallas. I am a first generation
Mexican-American who aims to be a full stack developer. The reason why I have choosen to study for years in 
the field of computer science, join professional organizations, and hackathons is quite simple. For me, 
it is a way to learn and grow. I am a very curious person and I love to learn about coding. The ability to 
create a program that can make an impact whether is for me, my friends and family, or for the public. I can 
create or help contribute in the creation of such a project. Just having the knowledge on how to create and more 
importantly know how to learn the skills to create better programs than the previous. That never ending cycle makes
the profession of being a software developer is the reason why I am here.
