During my sophmore year, one of the course projects was to create a random maze generator. The project used subsets to track the elements into a number of subsets. The main methods used are the union and find methods to link the elements given in the parameter and find the subset's root, respectively. Using a random generator to pick the elements at random, I kept using the union method to put the elements in the same subsets until the start and finish where in the same subset. Thus, a maze can be created. The program used C++ as the language.
