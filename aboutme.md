---

My name is **Allen David Hernandez**. I am a recent graduate of the University of Texas at Dallas. I am a first-generation Mexican-American who aims to have a successful career as a full-stack developer. The reason I chose to study for years in the field of computer science, join professional organizations, and participate in hackathons is quite simple.  

For me, computer science is a path of constant learning, growth, and self improvement. I am a very curious person and I love to learn more constantly about the intricacies of coding. The ability to create or help contribute to a program that can make an genuine impact whether it is for me, my friends and family, or for the public is exhilarating. Just knowing how to create and more importantly knowing how to learn the skills to create better programs than the previous ones. That never-ending cycle of improvement and advancement makes the profession of being a software developer my career of choice.
