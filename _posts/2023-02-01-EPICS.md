The elective course, EPICS, that I took during my last semester offered a huge learning curve as far as practical experience. In this course, I worked in creating a web application to build a database that could be used to track and maintain items and resources in inventory. Also, the project called for the integration of the web application and the database. 

I started the project by helping my teammates configure their setups to be able to work with containers. As most of the team were in their first year, I was the only non-freshmen developer on the team. I helped in providing pointers for their work on the front side of the project while also working on the API.

In working with the API, I learned to create routes, models, and schemas. Not only have I created muptiple crud routes for many entities where they may reference other entities, but I additionally tested the routes in order to ensure that they worked and were ready to connect the front with the back-end.

However, programming experience was not the only expertise that I gained during this semester long project. Throughout the length of the project, the team and I had many meetings with each other and our advisor, created many reports, and broke down numerous reports to fully understand the project. I believe this experience in teamwork, leadership, and workflow will be extremely valuable to me as I begin my career as a software developer.
