During my sophmore year, one of the course projects was to create a random maze generator. The project used subsets to track the elements into a number of subsets. The main methods used were the union and find methods, linking the elements given in the parameter, and finding the subset's root, respectively. Using a random generator to pick the elements at random, I repeatedly used the union method to put the elements in the same subsets until the start and finish where in the same subset. Thus, creating a maze randomly. The program was coded entirely in C++.
