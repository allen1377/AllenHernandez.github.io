During my four years attending The University of Texas at Dallas, I was part of the Society of Hispanic Engineers with varying amounts of activity. My involvement with SHPE ranges from being the community service chair in my second year, to being a part of the technology team, all the way to being a general member enjoying all the academic and social activities.  

More particularly, being a part of SHPE had allowed me to be able to learn about front-end software development, having the oppurtunity to work on the chapter's website. During the time I spent on the technology team, I was able to learn the basics of web design in html, css, and javascript.
