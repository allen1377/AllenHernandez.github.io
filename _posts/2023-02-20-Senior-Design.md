During the last semester of my senior year, my senior design project was to denerate an audit report and degree plan accurately, dynamically, and efficiently. My team and I used Java as our programming language, Javax swing for the graphical user interface, and used Apache POI to create the documents.

I particularly worked on the creation of the documents. The degree plan class took arrayList as parameters. The creation of the header and footer was filled from the information taken from the graduate students transcript. The middle rows over the information and categories are dynamically based on the courses taken from the transcript or input from the user. The audit report would get the courses and process the grades in order to calculate the core, elective, and overall gpa. Both of these produce a word document.
