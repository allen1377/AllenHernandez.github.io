During the four years of attending The University of Texas at Dallas I have been a part of the Society of Hispanic Engineers with varying amounts of activity. My involvement with SHPE ranges from being the community service chair in my second year to being a part of the technology team all the way to being a general member enjoying all the academin and social activities.  

More particularly, being a part of SHPE had allowed me to be able to learn about front-end software development. I was able to work on the chapters website. During the time spent on the technology team, I spent learning the basics of web design in html, css, and javascript.
