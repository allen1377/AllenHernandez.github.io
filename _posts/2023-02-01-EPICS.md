The elective course EPICS that I took during my last semester offered a huge learning curve in practical experience. In this course, I worked in creating a web application to build a database that can be used to track and maintain inventory and resources in inventory. Also, the project also calls for integration between the web application and the database. 

I started in the project with helping my teammates in setting up their setups to be able to work with containers. As most of the team were in their first year, I was the only non-freshmen developer on the team. I helped in pointers for their work on the front side of the project while also working on the API.

In working with the API has allowed me to learn to create routes, models, and schemas. Not only have I created muptiple crud routes for many entities where they may reference other entities. I also tested these routes in order to ensure that these routes worked and were ready to connect the front with the back-end.

However, programming experience was not the only experience that I gained during this semester long project. Throughout the length of the project, the team and I had many meetings with each other and our advicer, created many reports, and broke down numerous reports to fully understand the project. I believe this experience is extremely valuable in order to start my career as a software developer.
