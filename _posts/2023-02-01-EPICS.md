The elective course EPICS that I took during my last semester offered a huge learning curve in practical experience. In this course, I worked in creating a web application to build a database that can be used to track and maintain inventory and resources in inventory. Also, the project also calls for integration between the web application and the database. 

I started in the project with helping my teammates in setting up their setups to be able to work with containers. As most of the team were in their first year, I was the only non-freshmen developer on the team. I helped in pointers for their work on the front side of the project while I mostly worked on the API.

In working with the API has allowed me to learn to create routes, models, and schemas. Not only have I created muptiple crud routes for many entities where they may reference other entities. I also tested these routes in order to ensure that these routes worked and were ready to connect the front with the back-end. 

However, programming experience was not the only experience that I gained during this semester long project.
